# GitNexus-rs — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by gitnexus-rs as **frac-rs** (2775 symbols, 6537 relationships, 82 execution flows). Use the gitnexus-rs MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Call `graph_status` when freshness matters. Use `reanalyze` (incremental) or `gitnexus-rs analyze` (full). `detect_changes` does **not** re-index.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes({scope: "all"})` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- **Check graph freshness** with `graph_status` before trusting query/impact results on a repo you have been editing.
- **Update the graph** with `reanalyze` (incremental) or `gitnexus-rs analyze` (full). `detect_changes` does **not** re-index.
- **Uncommitted edits** while commit is fresh: `reanalyze` with `scope: "unstaged"`, or run `gitnexus-rs watch` in a terminal.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename`, which understands the call graph (it previews by default).
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes` to check affected scope.
